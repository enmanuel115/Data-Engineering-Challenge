# Data-Engineering-Challenge



1. Create data base with (CREATE_DATABASE_test.sql)
2. Create table with (create_table.py)
3. (ingest_procces.py) will run daily or as often as business needs in my case I used Windows Task Scheduler to schedule the process
4. To get the Trips with similar origin, destination, and time of day run the (Trips with similar.py)
5. To obtain the weekly average number of trips for an area run the (weekly average.py)
